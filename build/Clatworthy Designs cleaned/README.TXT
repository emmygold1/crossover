Removed "51" from DESIGN R25
Removed Design SR108 (Line 4 did not have 10 elements)
Removed SR36a.DAT (which is SR36.DAT without meta data)
Added meta data to DESIGN R153 (last to values are 0 since I don't know yet what they mean)
Design S24.DAT (inside it's called DESIGN S21?) has meta data: 9 12 6 3 3, but 15 instead of 12 rows
