Warn if the choosen combination of t, s and p does not 
allow to estimate all parameters due to insufficient degrees of freedom.

(CrossOver algorithm paper claims on page 4 that this is the case for "p = 3, n = 4, t = 4"
e.g. "FLETCHER FACTORIAL 2 x 2 DESIGN 1" for second-order carry-over effects.)

Look at R crossover package

Adaptive crossovers (also taking speed of recruiting into account)

A B C D E
- B A E C D
- - D E A C B
and so onâ€¦

Look at http://cran.r-project.org/web/views/ExperimentalDesign.html
especially http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/crossdes/index.html

design <- structure(c(1, 5, 1, 3, 2, 6, 2, 4, 3, 7, 9, 5, 4, 8, 10, 6), .Dim = c(4L, 4L))
design.efficiency(design)$av.eff.trt.pair.adj 
is bigger than 1

design <- structure(c(1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3), .Dim = c(5L, 3L))
design.efficiency(design)$av.eff.trt.pair.adj == 6.907292

Die speziellen Designs finden sich immer zusammengefasst in Paketen bzgl. der Autoren

- Calculations for the model with the full set of interactions are still most certainly wrong.
- Results from package crossdes "CrossDes Search Result for a D-optimal BIBD" don't make much sense and cause problems.
- The contrasts specified in the GUI are currently not passed to R but instead only equally weighted all-pair comparisons only for the treatment effects are assumed. (I forgot to uncomment a line before building...) But in R this should work fine!
- The package gives you not enough credit for your collection of examples and also I included your R-Code for comparison/testing purposes (and also the variances shown in the GUI are currently from general.carryover). 
- Warning if treatment effects are not estimable from design
