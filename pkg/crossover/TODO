Warn if the choosen combination of t, s and p does not 
allow to estimate all parameters due to insufficient degrees of freedom.

(CrossOver algorithm paper claims on page 4 that this is the case for "p = 3, n = 4, t = 4"
e.g. "FLETCHER FACTORIAL 2 x 2 DESIGN 1" for second-order carry-over effects.)

Look at R crossover package

Adaptive crossovers (also taking speed of recruiting into account)

A B C D E
- B A E C D
- - D E A C B
and so onâ€¦

Look at http://cran.r-project.org/web/views/ExperimentalDesign.html
